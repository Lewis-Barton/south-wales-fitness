                                If you are interested in joining us then there are a few ways in which you can go about this. You can sign up over the phone or by 
                                email. Alternatively, you can come into the centre and get signed up whilst you are there. For both of these options it is required 
                                that after you have been signed up that you complete a brief orientation process and the policies in place while in the facilities.

                                There are personal trainers that operate out of our facilities that can be booked for sessions within the centre if you so wish. The

                                If at any point you wanted to change the membership that you are currently on (you want to upgrade from basic to enhanced or vice 
                                versa). All you would have to do is contact the gym requesting this to be completed, we will then process this for you. Depending 
                                on when your previous membership was due to renew we would calculate if any money is owed to you, or required for the new membership,
                                 this will be disclosed during the process.

                                We recommend booking classes as soon as possible if you would like to guarantee your space for that time and date, however you can book 
                                classes as little as 1 hour prior to the start time. If you were not able to book the class beforehand, you can still come into the gym 
                                to see if there is space available for the class, this is not a guarantee that we can accomdate you.

                                to arrange a suitable time for this to be collected from the front desk.
