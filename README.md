# **[South Wales Fitness]()**

# **Project Description**

This project has been developed for my first Milestone project assignment following the Code Institue course I am currently completing. I have chosen the project idea from the list that was given of "Build a website for a gym"

I have decided to create a website for a fiction gym that is located in South Wales. After researching gyms that are located in my area I thought that I would take the information that I have found from these pre-exisiting companies and expand and adapt for the purposes of this project.

I have made some assumptions for this business for my User-Centric Front-End Development Milestone project. The gym has fixed schedules of the classes that occur, for which these schedule are the same each week and the same time, and they are included in the gym membership price.

From these assumptions and the information I have gathered I am using the 5 planes of UX methodology that has been explained within the course to; identify the user needs, the features are needed in the design, how the information is scturctured and logically grouped. These have then been used to produce a wireframe to show how this is implemented and a basis for what the project will look like on completion.

## User Stories
---

The intended audience of this website are users of any age who are looking for a gym to join, or existing members who are looking to find what classes are available and on what days.

Keeping this target audience in mind I have identified the below user stories:

1. As a user, it is easy to see the classes available and their schedule.

1. As a user, the site will be easy to navigate with minimal clicks to get to the correct information.

1. As a user, I will be able to see customer feedback from current or previous members.

1. As a user, it will be clear the pricing for a session and what is included in each session.

1. As a user, it will be easy to find information on the gym and the facilities available.

1. As a user, it will be easy to find contact information for the gym.

1. As a user, it will be easy to find external links for more frequent updates (social links, etc.)

From this I have also identified the following stories from an owner's perspective.

1. As the owner, it will be easy to display current offer's available within the gym.

1. As the owner, I will be able to fully showcase the facilities available.

1. As the owner, I will be able to showcase customer reviews to encourage new members.
